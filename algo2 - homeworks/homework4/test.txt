The Turkish Independence War was started when the first bullet was fired against the enemy during the occupation of Izmir by the Greek forces on 15 May 1919. 
Victors of the First World War, by signing of the Sevres Agreement, started the occupation of their shares of the Ottoman Empire. 
At the beginning, resistance against occupation forces started with militia forces, namely Kuva-i Milliye (National Forces). 
The Turkish Grand National Assembly established the regular army and successfully led the Independence War to victory by integrating the militia forces into the regular army.
